In this folder you'll find prebuilt swcs for both Flex 3 and Flex 4, if you're just using ObjectHandles in a project,
you can probably just plop one of those in your libs folder.

The other files are neccessary to build a swc with ant, create an archive of the source, and upload it all to google code.  You
probably won't need those.
